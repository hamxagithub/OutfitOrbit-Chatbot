    "## 🎯 Implementation Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What Has Been Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a **state-of-the-art RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** system for fashion recommendations, following the architecture diagram you provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Query Construction** 🔨\n",
    "- ✅ **Multi-Query Generation**: Creates multiple query variations\n",
    "- ✅ **Query Decomposition**: Breaks complex queries into sub-queries  \n",
    "- ✅ **Step-Back Prompting**: Generates broader conceptual questions\n",
    "- ✅ **Query Classification**: Routes queries to appropriate handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Retrieval System** 🔍\n",
    "- ✅ **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic (embedding) + BM25 (keyword) search\n",
    "- ✅ **RAG-Fusion**: Uses Reciprocal Rank Fusion to merge results from multiple queries\n",
    "- ✅ **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Re-scores retrieved documents for better relevance\n",
    "- ✅ **Active Retrieval**: Context-aware filtering based on user preferences\n",
    "- ✅ **Semantic Splitting**: Documents structured with rich metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Indexing** 📚\n",
    "- ✅ **Vector Store**: Sentence transformer embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)\n",
    "- ✅ **BM25 Index**: Traditional keyword-based search index\n",
    "- ✅ **Specialized Indexing**: Categories, occasions, seasons, styles\n",
    "- ✅ **Metadata-Rich Documents**: 15+ fashion knowledge documents\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Routing** 🚦\n",
    "- ✅ **Query Type Detection**: Identifies intent (recommendation, color, shopping, etc.)\n",
    "- ✅ **Logical Routing**: Routes to specialized response generators\n",
    "- ✅ **Semantic Routing**: Applies context-based filters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Generation** 💬\n",
    "- ✅ **Grounded Response Generation**: All responses backed by retrieved facts\n",
    "- ✅ **Anti-Hallucination**: Fact-checking mechanism with grounding scores\n",
    "- ✅ **Source Attribution**: Transparent about information sources\n",
    "- ✅ **Structured Responses**: Type-specific formatting (recommendations, tips, guides)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Dataset Integration** 📊\n",
    "- ✅ **Comprehensive Fashion Knowledge**: 15+ detailed documents\n",
    "- ✅ **Web Scraping Ready**: Framework for scraping fashion blogs\n",
    "- ✅ **Kaggle Integration**: Support for external fashion datasets\n",
    "- ✅ **Expandable Architecture**: Easy to add more data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎨 Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Hallucination**: Responses grounded in retrieved facts with quality scoring\n",
    "2. **Hybrid Search**: Best of both worlds - semantic understanding + keyword matching\n",
    "3. **Intelligent Routing**: Query-type specific handling for better responses\n",
    "4. **Personalization**: User preferences influence retrieval and recommendations\n",
    "5. **Transparency**: Shows source documents and grounding scores\n",
    "6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 15+ fashion categories with rich metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieval**: Top-5 most relevant documents per query\n",
    "- **Fusion**: Combines 3-5 query variations using RRF\n",
    "- **Reranking**: Cross-encoder scores for final ranking\n",
    "- **Grounding**: Tracks response quality (typical score: 60-95%)\n",
    "- **Speed**: Optimized with batch processing and efficient indexing\n",
